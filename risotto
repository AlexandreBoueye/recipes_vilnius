            <ul>
                <li>220gr of risotto rice </li>
                <li> 10 cl of white wine </li> 
                <li>1 or 2 onions (according to your taste) </li>
                <li> 1 stock cube (politry, beef, fish or vegetable) </li>
                <li> 20 grams of butter or 10cl of olive oil or both </li> 
                <li> 80 grams of parmesan cheese </li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li> In a saucepan, boil water with a stock cube (poultry if you make your risotto with poultry, vegetable if it is vegetarian, beef if you make it with marrow bones, and fish if you make it with shellfish. If you already have a ready-made broth because you have cooked before, use it, it will be better than the cube one. NOW you will forget about it a little bit. </li>
                <br>

                <li>Cut your onions. In a saucepan you fry your onions either with olive oil or butter or both. I have a preference for butter but that's personal. You are going to sweat (make them become transparent) your onions on a medium fire. Be careful not to let them turn brown.</li>
                <br>

                <li> Once the onions are translucent, put the rice in the pan with a knob of butter or a dash of olive oil. You will have to make the rice pearly: it will have to become transparent on the edges. Always on medium heat and do not stop stirring. </li>

                <li>Deglaze the rice and onions with a glass of dry white wine. Once the wine has completely evaporated, move on to the next step. Don't forget to stir the rice.</li>
                <br>

               
                <li>Once the rice is pearly, you will have to add gradually the broth that you prepared at the beginning. I advise you to add it two ladles by two ladles. Add two ladles and stir until the rice has absorbed the liquid and so on. The heat should be medium to low throughout the cooking process. Always stir to avoid that it catches at the bottom of the pan. </li>
                <br>

                <li>The risotto is cooked when you start to have a creamy texture with the rice. At this point you can add a knob of butter to make it even smoother. I also add a little white wine because I like to smell the wine at the end of the cooking in my rice but it's up to you. Also add parmesan cheese at the end to bind your risotto. </li>
                <br>

                <li>Now that you know how to make a classic risotto you can put whatever you want in it. You just have to ask me or find some recipes on the internet. </li>
